If they get through the day with all of them, they get rewards and there are stretch goals too.</p>\n<p>It was also an opportunity to get to work with css modules, mobx, firebase and stuff.</p>\n<p>Still missing charts, editable history, goals definitions and notifications, more emojis and animations. But collecting data it&apos;s a start.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cedmax/obey-kids/master/assets/screenshot.png\"></p>\n"
